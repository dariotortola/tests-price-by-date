The goal of this test is to create a REST endpoint with Spring Boot that returns information about the price of a product.
The service receives the ids of the brand and the product, plus a date to evaluate the price, because it may change due to promotions and whatnot.
It should return the ids of product, brand and fee, plus the dates the fee is applicable, plus the price.
